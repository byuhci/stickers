The practical interface for interactive temporal data annotation used for my Thesis proposal.

## Project Structure
The main application code is housed in the `/src/app/` directory.
This is further broken down into several 
[Angular modules](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules#angular-modularity) 
for convenience and modularity.

The main module for the user interface is located in the `/src/app/dataview` module.
Further details on it can be viewed in its corresponding README.
